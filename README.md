## Assignment Tracker - Gabriel Olafsson

https://a4-gabrielolafs.vercel.app/

This is a page that allows users to track their assignments. The main page shows all the assignments the user has 
entered with information about them sucha as due date. The user can mark the assignment finished by clicking the 
complete checkbox, add new assignments which default to not completed, or delete assignments. 

Since A3 I have:
- added React components
- tighter new account requirements 
-    no creation of accounts with duplicate usernames
-    type password twice
